# K8S-ML
This is a template for training and serving machine learning models. 
The service consists of a docker-ized flask application, which will ultimately be deployed in a kubernetes cluster. Before running the machine learning service in Kubernetes, we can run it using docker-compose to ensure that everything works correctly before putting it into kubernetes.
